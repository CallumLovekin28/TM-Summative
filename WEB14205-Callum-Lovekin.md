### Introduction

This project on User Experience was a really interesting one that I have learnt alot. Having the ability to of worked on a live brief with an actual client was a really invaluable experience. Working on an App for a museum has been a challenging experience but an exciting one as it is not something I would usually work on so it has pushed me.
