### Introduction

This project on interactive narratives was an interesting one and I have learnt a lot about how stories are told. Grasping Trans-Media was something I struggled with in the beginning but have now a solid understanding of what it means and examples. I feel confident with the information I have learnt.

![Concept](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CallumLovekin28/TM-Summative/master/Images/Concept.png)

The Trans-Media story we have created is a really interesting one and focuses alot on physical experience as well as social media interaction. To go along with the story we will have multiple pop up Victorian Streets around London that will act as part of a communal game that goes along with the story. 

People can go to these streets and look around for clues to progress the story, these physical pop up streets will be timed and if the public fail to find all the clues during the giving time it will have a negative effect on the progression of the story. Once people find these icons they tweet a picture of them to the social media profile of the protagnoist and it responds with the next part of the story.
